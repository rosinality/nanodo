# For a tensor with dims (n1, n2, ..., nk) a partitioning must be specified of
# size (p1, p2, ..., pk).
# Here we partition over one dim only, so exactly one pi = "data" and the rest
# should be None. This means, partition the tensor on dim i over the "data" axis
# and not on the rest. Note that the "data" axis is the axis used for data
# parallel, and corresponds to the number of devices.
# The condition is that ni must be divisible by number of devices, so this
# partitioning therefore chooses the partitioning axis to be the model dim
# as this is usually divisible by number of devices.
